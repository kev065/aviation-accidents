## **Business Understanding**
### **Background**
As part of our strategic initiative to diversify our company's portfolio, we are venturing into the aviation industry. This expansion involves purchasing and operating airplanes for both commercial and private enterprises. Given the high stakes associated with aviation, understanding the potential risks and ensuring the highest standards of safety is paramount for the success and sustainability of this new business endeavor.

### **Objective**
My primary objective is to identify the aircraft models that present the lowest risk in terms of safety and operational reliability. This involves a comprehensive analysis of historical aviation accident data to evaluate the safety performance of various aircraft manufacturers and models. The goal is to provide actionable insights that will guide the decision-making process for the acquisition of aircraft, ensuring that we select models with proven safety records.

## **Data Understanding**
To achieve this objective, I have utilized the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/khsamaha/aviation-accident-database-synopses), which includes detailed information on civil aviation accidents from 1962 to 2023. The analysis focuses on key metrics such as fatality rates, injury rates, and the number of uninjured passengers and crew in accidents. These metrics are crucial for assessing the overall safety performance of different aircraft models.

The decision on which aircraft to purchase will be based on the following criteria derived from our analysis:
1. Uninjured Rate - The proportion of passengers and crew who remain uninjured in the event of an accident.
2. Fatality Rate - The number of fatalities per accident involving the aircraft.
3. Variety and Availability: The range of models available from the manufacturer and their suitability for our intended operations i.e. commercial and private travel.
